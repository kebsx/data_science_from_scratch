# Baye's Theorem
### Example

P(Has Disease) = 1/10000 = 0.0001, P(Does Not Have Disease) = 0.9999
P(True Postive) = 0.99, P(False Postive) = 0.01

P(D | T) (You have the diesease conditional on a postive test) = P(T|D)P(D)/[P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|NOT D)P(NOT D)]
=> 0.99(0.001)/[0.99(0.001) + 0.01(0.999)] = 0.0098 or 0.98% chance of having the diesease with a postive test

# Random Variables
- A random variable is avariable whose possible values have associated prob dist
- Somtimes talk about the expected value of a random variable
- Can be conditioned like with other Variables
    - Exmaple is with the two children, If x is the random variable reprsenting the number of girls
    - x = 0 with a prob of 1/4
    - x = 1 with a prob of 1/2
    - x = 2 with a prob of 1/4
    - We can the define a variable Y that repersents the number of girls with condition of one of the children being a girls
    - Y = 1 with a prob of 2/3
    - Y = 2 with a prob of 1/3
    - Z would equeal a variable where the condition is that the oldest child is a girl
    - Z = 1 with a prob of 1/2
    - Z = 2 with a prob of 1/2

# Hypothesis and Inference
We translate hypotheses into stats about data we can then think of these stats as
observations that of random variables from known dists
In our classical setup we have a null hypothesis reprsenting some default position
and alternative that we are trying to prove, we use stats to decide if we can
reject the null postion 

### Example
We have a coin, we are going to assume that out null hypothesis is that the coin
is fair so we have H0 -> p=0.5, out H1 would be that the coin isn't fair so
H1 -> P != 0.5
We test by fliiping the coin n times and count the number of heads X
This means that each trial or X is a Binomial(n, p) variable and we can approximate
using the normal dist
